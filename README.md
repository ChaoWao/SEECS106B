## IN THE END
-------------

The handout 34 says:
>Voila! Think back to where you were at the beginning of CS106B, when pointers were mysterious
>and you knew little of recursion or the power and beauty of ADTs. Today you completed a program
>that shows your mettle with over a half-dozen classes, spicy pointers, recursive data structures,
>elegant algorithms, and impressive skills for designing, implementing, and debugging a sophisticated
>project. Congratulations! I hope you are as proud as I am of what you have accomplished!

I hope, too.
